            <p>Happy Valentine's Day my love! This is our calendar where we can look back at our relationship and all the fun times we had! I look forward to adding more here in the future! I hope you enjoy it! :))</p>

        The way we met might not have been the most interesting story, but we can always portray it to be what we want it to be. You may notice that the color of the circle matches that of a certain website that we talked on. However, I would rather say we met in high school or at least we knew of each other then. Regardless of how we met, I want to say how incredibly lucky I am to have you in my life. I may say this a lot, but I mean it every time; you make me so happy!
        <p>The first message you ever sent me was "Hiya ðŸ˜Š." This was over winter break at the start of 2024. From there we talked a bit, but we both had to go back to university, so we couldn't meet right away. Follow the path to see what happens next!</p>

        <p>This circle marks our first date. We went bowling in Dublin and to Panera for dinner! I was so nervous when walking up to your door, but when you opened it, all I could think was how pretty you were. I loved how competitive you were when we played, and I had a lot of fun that night. I was quite shy and I didn't know what to talk about, so I apologize for that, but I still hope you had fun! I liked how we just went on a walk afterwards, plus you give amazing hugs!</p>

        <p>Onto to our second date! We went minigolfing at Boomers in Livermore, and then we went to Chili's! I have never met someone who loves Chili's as much as you do, but I find it funny and one of the most adorable things ever! Although I have yet to try their margaritas, I know we will be going back soon! Afterwards we to the park, and in that moment I felt that I could open up to you. You are easy to talk, and given our similar experiences, I think we can easily understand each other.</p>

        <p>For our third date, we went to Color Me Mine! Your artistic abilities are clearly way better than mine! I hope your pot has been of use, or at least decoration! We went to SideTrack Bar and Grill for food afterwards! Although this is not as competitive as minigolf or bowling, it was nice to doing something relaxing together! I also believe this is the first date where showed me how much love DisneyLand! </p>

        <p>We of course had to pick up our pottery from Color Me Mine! Perfect reason for our fourth date! We got our goodies, and then we got ramen! Of course we had to get some dessert as well because one of us really likes sugar, I wonder who? The pastries were very good I must admit, so good choice by you! Just sitting at the park and spending time with you was so nice. I love people watching, and with you, it was a lot of fun!</p>

        <p>For our sixth and last date of the summer, we went go karting! Being an F1 fan, I was not surprised how well you did, even though you are a professional passenger princess! Again, I love your competitive spirit, it makes activities so fun! At the end, I was sad that I had to leave for school and that I wouldn't see you for a while.</p>

        <p>During the four months we were apart in the fall, we didn't stay in touch the entire time. However, we startly communicated regularily in November and from there we texted and called. I was happy to talk to you again because there was a part of me that missed you and I really wanted to be a bigger part of your life. Through that, I felt like it allowed us to get closer and reconnect over winter break.</p>

        <p>Now we are at our first date back together and our seventh date total! We went driving around the neighborhoods in Pleasanton and Livermore looking at all the Christmas decorations. Of course, we had a little pit stop at Starbucks before departing on our journey! This wasn't something I had done before and I admit I'm not the most festive person. However, doing this with you was so fun, and I really appreciate you sharing this Christmas activity with me! I loved the houses that had the radios that we could tune into which were synchronized with the lights. My engineering brain was going crazy, but it was cool looking at the lights with you. Also, the treats you made me were extremely good! And thank you for telling me that we would be wearing pajamas, because I would have worn some weird outfit if you hadn't!</p>

        <p>Our next date was not the best planned, but it was still enjoyable because you were there! I can't believe we had to wake up at like 8 am to go watch Mufasa. It was funny how both of us were on the brink of falling asleep while watching the movie. And of course afterwards, we got Mendocino Farms and some ice cream! The ice cream came first of course!</p>

        <p>Our next date was probably one of my favorites! We went wine tasting together at Las Positas Vineyards. My first official wine tasting, and there is no one I would have rather done it with. I'm just happy we didn't break any of the wine glasses given how clumsy we both can be! Their wines were really and so was the bacon. I also find it funny how your favorite wine is the one wine that I can't pronounce: Coccineous. My best attempt sounded something like Cocihineausou! After the winery, we watched our basketball teams play, and that was a little stressful to be honest, but I enjoyed the extra time with you.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if you would consider this a date, but I just wanted to add it because any time I get to spend with you is special to me. The day before Christmas, we went on an hour long walk at Shadow Cliffs. Although we didn't do anything special, just spending time with you was I wanted.</p>

        <p>For our next date, we went to the restaurant Sons of Liberty in Livermore. You seem to really like this restaurant given how you went here twice within a week! They do have some good food and some strong but tasty drinks! And like most dates we had, we got some dessert afterwards! It was my first time going to Simply Fondue, but you convinced me, they're pretty good. Their drinks are hella strong, oh my goodness! The chocolate fondue was really delicious though, and I'll make sure you don't run out of cookie dough! Thank you for driving me to my car the next day!</p>

        <p>This date was much needed for me as I do not have many clothes unforunately, or at least many good clothes to wear. Like many dates, it was my first time going to some place new, and in this case, it was Sephora. They have a lot of stuff which I know nothing about, but if you ever need to go again, I'll gladly join you! Thank you for helping me pick out some clothes; I think I'm starting to dress a bit better now! Plus you have my mom's approval when it comes to clothing! I still need a pair of dark jeans though, so we will definitely need to go shopping some more!</p>

        <p>This might have been one of my favorite dates! Not only did we get to go to one of your favorite restaurants, Sonic, but I also got to watch a hockey game with you! My first time at Sonic was pretty good I must admit. The food was decent, especially since you had to feed me most of my meal, which was interesting to say the least! Although we lost and there were no fights, I was still really happy to spend the evening with you. Sorry if my driving scares you.</p>

        <p>For this date, we headed back once more to Simply Fondue! Unfortunately, this was also our last date together over winter break. Despite that, I had an amazing time. You dropped a crouton, and I dropped my utensils everywhere, the classic Lindsay and Xavier move! The fondue itself was really tasty! I still need to make you one though, and see which one you prefer. </p>

        <p>This marks our first virtual date, and although it is not what I expected we would be doing, I had a great time! I may be slighly addicted to Club Penguin now, but it's worth it! I know it's not the same as being in the same room, but I was still over the moon to see your beautiful face and do something together and just talk to you. I miss you so much Lindsay.</p>
